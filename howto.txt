I've attached 10 seconds of collected data from the free version of the Data Collection app. The raw values are ordered as x, y, and z for gyro (deg/s), magnetometers (microteslas), and accelerometers (g-force). Attitude (degrees) is ordered as pitch, roll, and yaw (if available.) You can get the app here.
